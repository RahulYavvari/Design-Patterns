# Design Patterns
This repository contains examples and implementations of various design patterns in C++. Each design pattern demonstrates different ways to solve common design problems and improve code maintainability and flexibility.

## Contents

- [Strategy Pattern](#strategy-pattern)
- [Observer Pattern](#observer-pattern)

## Strategy Pattern

The Strategy Pattern is used to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. It lets the algorithm vary independently from the clients that use it.

- **[Strategy Pattern Implementation](StrategyPattern)**

## Observer Pattern

The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

- **[Observer Pattern Implementation](ObserverPattern)**

## Getting Started
To get started with these design patterns:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/RahulYavvari/design-patterns.git
    ```

2. Open the solution file (`DesignPatterns.sln`) in Visual Studio. Each design pattern is set up as a separate project within the solution.

3. Alternatively, you can compile and run the `main.cpp` file in each pattern's folder using your preferred C++ compiler.


## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have a design pattern you would like to add or improve, please fork the repository and create a pull request.
